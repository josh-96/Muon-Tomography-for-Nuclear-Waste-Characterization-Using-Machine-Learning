# **Muon Tomography Analysis Framework: Statistical and Machine Learning Approaches**

## **Description**
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook showcasing the application of advanced statistical and machine learning methodologies to optimize the analysis of muon tomography data. The notebook explores techniques for enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of image processing and data interpretation in the context of nuclear waste container characterization.

The methods implemented address challenges such as noise, uncertainty, and data sparsity in muon tomography, aiming to refine predictions and accelerate the decision-making process.

## **Objective**
To propose a series of statistical and AI-based approaches for optimizing machine learning performance in analyzing and interpreting muon tomography data, including:  
1. Reducing noise in captured images.  
2. Modeling uncertainty and variability in muon detection and interactions.  
3. Enabling robust data augmentation for model training.  

## **Key Features**
The notebook implements the following techniques:  

### **1. Monte Carlo Simulations**  
- Simulates noisy data to mimic real-world muon tomography conditions.  
- Used for data augmentation and robust training of machine learning models.  

### **2. Poisson Distribution**  
- Models the rate of muon detection events.  
- Captures variability in the occurrence of events for improved statistical representation.  

### **3. Markov Chains**  
- Simulates transition probabilities of muons interacting with shielding materials.  
- Provides a probabilistic framework for modeling particle interactions.  

### **4. Kaplanâ€“Meier Survival Analysis**  
- Incorporates time-dependent interaction probabilities between muons and container materials.  
- Models realistic scenarios for time-dependent decay and interaction tracking.  

### **5. Zonotopic Dempster-Shafer Structures (DSZ)**  
- Combines geometric uncertainty modeling (zonotopes) with evidence-based reasoning (DST).  
- Enhances prediction reliability by accounting for noise and incomplete data in captured images.
